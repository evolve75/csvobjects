<body>

Provides a framework for parsing and reading CSV files transparently, via meta-data definitions, a'la Hibernate. 
This allows yor application's CSV processing and parsing logic to be completely transparent and dependent only
on POJO JavaBean representation of the the CSV records.

<p>
The main class for the framework is {@link net.sf.anupam.csv.CSVParser CSVParser}, which provides a {@link java.lang.Iterable Iterable}
interface for parsing and retrieving the POJO beans from the CSV records transparently. Configuration of the parser is done via
XML mapping files. 
</p>

<p>
The {@link net.sf.anupam.csv.CSVParserFactory CSVParserFactory} is the main factory for creation and
instantiation on the CSV parsers.
</p>

<p>
Implementation of the parser is based on <a href="http://ostermiller.org/utils/">Steven Ostermiller's</a> excellent
CSV parsing engine.
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

Configuration of the CSV to POJO mapping is done via an XML mapping file, which 
should be named <code>csv-mapping.xml</code>. The file needs to be present
in the <code>CLASSPATH</code> at the root level. 

<p>
The parser framework provides convenience 
<a href="http://xdoclet.sourceforge.net">Xdoclet</a> tagsets and 
templates for auto-generation of the mapping XML file directly from the
POJOs being mapped. This is similar to the <code>Xdoclet</code> support
for <a href="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</a> persistance framework, 
and behaves in a similar fashion in terms of the mapping and configuration 
generation.
</p>

<p>
Format of the file is:<br>


<code>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
<br>

&lt;csv-mapping&gt;
<br>	
	&lt;bean-mapping name="declarative name of the POJO bean to be mapped"
<br>
	              class="fully qualified name of the POJO's class"&gt;
<br>	
	&lt;/bean-mapping&gt;
<br>
&lt;/csv-mapping&gt;

</code>
<p>

<h2>Logging and Debugging</h2>

<p>
The framework uses the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/">Jakarta Commons logging</a> as its logging framework. 
Any standard setup (including <a href=""http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/">Log4j</a>) can be used as the actual logger.
</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Note that the current implementation is <strong>read-only</strong> 
and does not offer any mechanism for writing out Java objects to CSV files.</li>

<li>The current implementation is <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/index.jsp">Java 1.5</a> only</li>
</ul>
