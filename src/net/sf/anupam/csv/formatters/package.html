<title>net.sf.anupam.csv.formatters package</title>

</head>
<body>

Provides a framework and default implementations for formatting CSV fields during
the CSV to POJO parsing. The framework is configurable and can be extended if
the default formatters are not sufficient.

<p>
In most usage situations, no formatting is required on the CSV fields during parsing,
and data formatting can be performed on the source CSV data itself. 

</p>

<p>
However, minor formatting is necessary in certain circumstances, e.g., 
when only part of a CSV field value needs to be mapped to a POJO attribute. Common
examples include extracting the first name from a full name, or changing the
case of the input string value. This functionality is enabled by this package.
</p>

<h2>Default Formatters</h2>

<p>
The following formatters are present in the default system. The declarative formatter
name is in brackets. Details on each formatter is present in the respective
class' documentation.

<ul>
<li>{@link net.sf.anupam.csv.formatters.DoNothingFormatter DoNothingFormatter} <em>(none)</em></li>
<li>{@link net.sf.anupam.csv.formatters.DoNothingFormatter firstWordFormatter} <em>(firstWord)</em></li>
<li>{@link net.sf.anupam.csv.formatters.DoNothingFormatter lastWordFormatter} <em>(lastWord)</em></li>
<li>{@link net.sf.anupam.csv.formatters.DoNothingFormatter AllUpperCaseFormatter} <em>(AllUpperCase)</em></li>
</ul>

</p>

<h2>Configuration of Formatters</h2>

<p>
The formatters are registered into the CSV parser framework via the
<code>csv-formatter-config.xml</code> XML file. The file defines the
logical formatter name, and the formatter implementation class name.
</p>

<h2>Custom Formatters</h2>
<p>
Customer formatters can be created by implementing the 
{@link net.sf.anupam.csv.formatters.CSVFieldFormatter CSVFieldFormatter} 
interface, and its sole method: <code>String format(String)</code>. This method
acts as the transformation/formatting implementation. It is recommended that
the custom formatters be stateless and provide re-entrant implementations.
</p>

<p>
Once the custom formatters are defined, they can be registered in the
Framework by updating the <code>csv-formatter-config.xml</code> configuration file.
A custom <code>Xdoclet</code> template/tagset is provided for ease of 
generating the configuration XML file.
