# CSVObjects

## Introduction

[CSVObjects](http://csvobjects.org) (earlier known as `CSVParser`) is a Java library and framework for parsing CSV
(Comma Separated Value) files, and populating user defined Java Bean attributes from the CSV field values.

The framework is based on declarative configuration of the mapping of the CSV fields to the users' Java bean objects.
This is performed via a `csv-mapping.xml`.

The mapping XML itself can be automatically generated via custom `Xdoclet` tags in the target Java Bean comments.

The project is distributed under the GNU Public License (GPL). See the `LICENSE` file for details.

## Installation

If you have downloaded the binary file release, then you need to include the `CSVObjects-<release_number>.jar` file in
