CSVObjects (http://www.csvobjects.org/)
=========

1. Introduction

CSVObjects (earlier known as CSVParser) is a Java library and framework 
for parsing the common CSV (Comma Separated Value) files, and populating user defined Java
Bean attributes from the CSV field values.

The framework is based on declarative configuration of the mapping of
the CSV fields to the users' Java bean objects. This is performed via
a csv-mapping.xml.

The mapping XML itself can be automatically generated via custom Xdoclet
tags in the target Java Bean comments.

The project is distributed under the GNU Public License (GPL). See the
file LICENSE for details.

2. Installation

If you have downloaded the binary file release, then you need to include the
